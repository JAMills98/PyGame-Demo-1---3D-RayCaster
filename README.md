# PyGame-Demo-1---3D-RayCaster
3D Raycaster using Barrel Projection, that's it.
WASD to move, mouse to look left/right.

Game draws blue columns to represent the distance.

Unfortunately, the projection isn't proper, it's curvilinear. This means the perspective is curved towards the player.

# Requirements
* Python 3.x, 2.x works fine as divison is needed from __future__
* Following Modules: pygame, math, os, ctypes
